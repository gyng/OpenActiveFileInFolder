# Open active file in folder

A small Sublime Text 3 plugin to open the directory the active file is in as a folder, in a new window.

## Install

Not on [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/)'s main channel, so you can either install it [manually](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15652758/how-to-install-plugins-to-sublime-text-2-editor/26553490#26553490) or via Package Control with a bit of added work:

1. Command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Command+Shift+P`)
2. `Package Control: Add Repository`
3. `https://github.com/gyng/OpenActiveFileInFolder/`
4. `Package Control: Install Package` â–º `OpenActiveFileInFolder`

## Usage

1. Command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Command+Shift+P`)
2. `Open active file in folder: Do it`
